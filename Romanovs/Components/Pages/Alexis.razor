<h2>Alexis</h2>


<h3>Early life</h3>
Alexis was born in Moscow on March 19th 1629. He spent much of his early life preparing for eventually succeeding his father as Tsar.<br />
To this extent, he was educated with a rigorous curriculum. His chief tutor, Boris Morozov, would have a profound effect on him and followed<br />
him into power when he became Tsar at the age of 16 when his father passed away in 1645. Alexis's mother, eudoxia, passed away just five weeks after<br />
his father.

<h3>reign</h3>
Alexis was well prepared for ruling russia. He inherited an unenviable position just like his father. The Tatar Khan had launched an invasion into the South<br />
of Russia and the Polish King was harboring one of the pretenders to the Russian throne. Alexis was crowned as Tsar on July 23rd 1645. Alexis was commonly called <br />
"the Young Monk" on account of his zealousy and care for religion.Alexis spent much of his day in church every day. He would wake up at 4:00 AM every morning and<br />
pray in his privater chapel for 20 minutes before continuing withhis day. He would pray again in the late afternoon for another half hour and pray again in the <br />
evening for another 20 minutes. Alexis held the church in high esteem and constantly criticized church officials who he thought were not loyal and didn't take their<br />
duties seriously.An example of this would accur early in his reign when a steward of a monastery got drunk during a service. Alexis dictated a letter to the Patriarch<br />
calling for the removal of the steward whom he called " a God-hater, Christ seller, singleminded little Satan, damned scoffing enemy and wicked evil doer." The Patriarch<br />
talked the Tsar into forcing the steward to publicly atone for his sins. On the same day as his coronation. a year after Alexis's coronation, Morozov succeeded in securing <br />
a wife for the Tsar. The Tsar married Maria Miloslavskaya in January of 1646. Morozov was removed after Alexis and his wife were seized by a mob<br />of peasants who pleaded<br />
with him to , in Alexis's own words, "Remove the bloodsuckers from the government." The crowd was adamant that Alexis remove Leonid Pleshcheev, a<br />
powerful boyar and ally of Morozov who held many important offices in Moscow. Alexis promised to launch an investigation. When alexis launched his investigation he found<br />
countless records of Morozov's corruption. After Morozov's removal and replacement, he was exiled to a monastery in 1648. Alexis was deeply affected by Morozov's betrayal<br />
and still cared about him despite his corruption having written to the leaders of the peasants " I have sworn to give Morozov to you and while I cannot justify his actions<br />
I cannot give him up to death. This person is dear to me. The husband of the Tsarina's sister. It would be hard to give him to those who wish for his death." Alexis would make<br />
many reforms during his reign and would subdue several rebellions(see 17-19th Centuries).

<h3>Death and legacy</h3>
Alexis died in 1676 at the age of 46. His reign saw Russia gain victory against the Poles, further entrench itself into Serfdom and subdue multiple rebellions. Alexis's reign<br />
was notable for his removal of corrupt officals and ability to balance the budget of the Tsardom. Alexis would be succeeded by his sons and one of his daughters who fought over the<br />
until Alexis's son <a href="/PeterI">Peter</a>, soon to be Peter the Great, became Tsar.
